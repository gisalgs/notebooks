    "The goal of a map projection is to transform points in a spherical coordinate system onto a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. In other words, points on earth surface that are measured in longitude ($\\lambda$) and latitude ($\\varphi$) pairs become points on a two dimensional plane measured as horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) coordinates. We can imagine there are functions that takes in the longitude and latitude of a point and returns the X and Y coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = f(\\lambda, \\varphi)$  \n",
    "$y = f(\\lambda, \\varphi)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward transformation from a mathematical perspective is the special case of the **equirectangular** projection that basically does not do anything other than just use the longitude as the X coordinate, and latitude as Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = \\lambda$  \n",
    "$y = \\varphi$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how any projection actually looks like, we will need the appropriate data sets to begin with. Specifically we need two kinds of data here, the world coast lines and the graticule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The world coast lines from Natural Earth, in two formats:\n",
    "    * A shapefile that is compressed as a tar.gz file at the [Github site](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.tar.gz) (need to uncompress it after downloading).\n",
    "    * A GeoJSON file at the [Github site](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson). Click on the Raw button to save the file or directly download it at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gisalgs/data/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson.\n",
    "    * Both file formats can be useful on local computers. However, the GeoJSON is also suitable for online notebooks and can be used without being downloaded to local computers as well. This is also a place to re-enforce the difference between the two formats and appreciate why GeoJSON has picked so much popularity lately. Clicking on [this link](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson) allows us to see immediately rendering of the spatial data in the GeoJSON file, which is made possible by a lot of reasons but first reason being everything in the spatial data is encoded in ONE place/file and in plain text. This enables the file to be read and processed easily in different programming languages. [Here](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/uscnty48area.geojson) is another example of GeoJSON using the counties data. But shapefile, unfortunately, is not designed in this way, which is understandable given how old this one is, because it has multiples file encoded in binary code that must be specially decoded.\n",
    "* The graticule, however, is not stored in a file (though we could certainly do that). Instead, we will dynamically generate the graticule using Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating the graticule\n",
    "\n",
    "> The term graticule is commonly used in cartography, referring to the network formed by the lines of latitudes and longitudes, or parallels and meridians. Sometimes people use the term grid for this purpose, but we as geospatial professionals should know better: lines that form a grid are not necessarily parallels and meridians. We can use any lines to make up a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first find a way to systematically generate the lines of latitudes and longitudes. Before we get to the coding part, let's decide how we want our data to be organized. While there are many ways to do this, the bottom line for an projection is that we must be able to change the coordinates of each point from one system to another. There is not way this can be avoid. For this reason, we will literally store each point individually. Along with the point's coordinates, we also give it a unique number that indicates which line this point belongs to. For example, we make sure `[12, -83, 40]` is the point that is on a line with an ID of 12, and the coordinates of the point is -83, 40 (sounds familiar?). We will then put all the points in this way, in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to get the points on the graticule first. We can't get all the points because that wold be infinite number of them. Instead, we use an interval of 10 for the points on the parallels and meridians. Now we have the code:"

    "So how do we know the the Sinusoidal projection is equal-area? There are a lot of signs we can tell. For example, we can examine how the graticule looks. There are patterns that an equal area projection should follow (as discussed in many cartography classes) and we can use those to make some educated conclusions. We can also use math to tell. For a project based on a sphere with a unit radius, an equal area projection will have the following property (Snyder 1987, p. 28):\n",

    "$$\n",

We can actually do some more visualization using a device called [Tissot's indicatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix). The idea is to put some infinitely small circles of the same size (mathematically unit size) at different places on the globe and then see how they look after they are projected. The original tool is a mathematically tool (who else would be interested in circles that are infinitely small?), but we can definitely relax it a little bit by using some circles that are more legible. There is a GeoJSON file that contains some circles at our [github geom repo](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/tissot.geojson) and we will see how to use it here."
