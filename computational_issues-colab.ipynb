    "The computational time for trees can be broken down to at least two parts. The first is the time used to construct the tree, and then it is the time the tree is used to query. The overall time complexity of building a balanced k-D tree is $O(n \\log_2 n)$. Searching a k-D only takes $O(\\log_2 n)$ time in average when the tree is balanced. For unbalanced trees, however, we can imagine a worst case where points are always aligned on one branch of the node and in this case the search time is $O(n)$, as same as the linear search (though the actual time might be longer because traversing a tree takes more time than traversing a list or an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "For point quadtrees, the cost of building a point quadtree is $O(n \\log_4 n)$ when points are randomly sorted before they are inserted to the tree as we discussed above. A simple search on a balanced point quadtree has a time complexity of $O(\\log_4 n)$ while the worst case would be $O(n)$ when the tree has only one node at each depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussion, however, is theoretical. In practice, the actual computational time may follow the overall trend as predicted, but there are also many other factors that have significant impacts on the performance. For example, the physical time used can vary a lot depending on whether the program is compiled into binary code (as C/C++ programs) or interpreted (as Python and Java). Generally speaking, interpreted programming languages such as Python are less efficient in terms of the actual running time because the code must be interpreted line by line. It should be noted that Python or Java is not the interpreted language in its original meaning where the interpreter literally goes through line by line for every time it runs the program. Instead, they often use an immediate representation of the code that is compiled in binary that runs faster. Still, interpreted languages are still generally slower than compiled languages such as C/C++. The difference may not be noticeable for small data (and probably we don't really care), but the difference will be big when we deal with large data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the programming language, how the algorithms are actually implemented will be a factor too. For example, the use of recursive functions, as convenient as it is, slows down the algorithm because of the repeated recursive function calls. \n",

We know that constructing such a tree takes time, and from the previous experiments, we also know that at some point the use of a k-D tree for searching may be excessive because we will have to traverse the tree back and forth too many times that will be more than just using a linear search.
