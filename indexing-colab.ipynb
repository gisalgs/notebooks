    "An **algorithm** is a process that contains a set of well designed steps for calculation. For example, we can design a process to tell that, given any integer, what is the next odd number. The word algorithm is from latin _algorismus_, which is from _al-Khwa-rizmī_, a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. There are two aspects to evaluate an algorithm: its **correctness** and **time complexity**. We focus on the latter here. Time complexity is also called running time, though the term \"running\" is not accurate because we are not really talking about how the algorithm actually runs but in theory how the computation grows with the problem size. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the fundamental concepts of time complexity. There will be four short videos associated this tutorial. They are listed below and will also be referred to in the tutorial. \n",

    "A commonly used type of algorithms is **search**. For example, if we have a database of cities, we may want to find if a city is in the database so that we can pull information for that city. Search comes in different shapes and here we are going to generalize such tasks as searching for one dimensional information as represented using a series of numbers. These numbers can be considered as the IDs of some entities. In later part of this module we will explore how multiple dimensions in the data (such as points in spatial data) can be utilized for search. \n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest form of search is called **linear search**, which is a process that goes through all the items in our data and the search will stop when we either find the item we are searching for or we reach the end of all the items. Let us assume we have a list of numbers named `nums` (e.g., `nums = [1, 2, 9, 12, 15, 29, 32, 91, 4, 11]` or `num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`) and we want to find if number `j` is in the list.

    "To understand the time complexity of linear search, let's assume\n",
    "\n",
    "* Getting a number (or point) out of the list takes $c_1$ time (line 1)\n",
    "* Comparing if two numbers (points) are the same takes $c_2$ time (line 2)\n",
    "* Returning the result takes $c_3$ time (line 3)\n",
    "* $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ are constants\n",

    "\n",
    "* There are best cases and worst cases\n",
    "* In the worst case scenario, $c_1$ and $c_2$ will be run up to $n$ times, and $c_3$ will be run once\n",
    "* Therefore the total time is $c1 \\times n + c2 \\times n + c3$\n",
    "* In average, we will take $c1 \\times n/2 + c2 \\times n/2 + c3$, which can be generalized as $(n \\times b + c)$, where $b = (c1+c2)/2$\n",
    "\n",

    "We don't really care much about $b$ and $c$ -- they are constant and are always relatively small. But the value of n tells how running time **grows** with the data. We use a growth function to tell the running time. More specifically, if we know there is a definitive upper bound of the running time, we use a **Big-O** notation to denote the growth. In the case of the linear search algorithm, we have a running time of $O(n)$. The above algorithm is called **linear search** for a reason: the time used is linear to the size of input. \n",

    "\n",
    "What we have explored so far is to **search** for something useful from a set of data. More specifically, what we have seen is a way of linear search: we just go from one end of the data to the other end. A linear search can work, but there are better ways to find info from a list. Let's consider what will happen if we re-arrange the data in the original list into a special tree structure as illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/trees-2.png\" width=300/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we actually do the analysis, let's first introduce some key concepts of indexing and binary tree; we will then write some code to test these concepts. The idea of indexing is a huge topic and Donald E. Knuth designated a whole volume to this topic (Volume 3: Sorting and Searching) in his classic series titled *The Art of Computer Programming*. We will only touch the most basic ideas in this scope as a preparation for spatial indexing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are an important means to organizing data. A **tree** contains multiple **nodes** where each node can have **child nodes** and **parent nodes**, except for the **root** node that does not have parent nodes and **leaf nodes** that do not have child nodes. The linkages between nodes are called the **edges**. The root serves as the access point to the entire tree. The tree illustrated above represents the sequence of numbers ranging from 1 to 7 in a **binary** fashion where each node can have up to two child nodes, and for each given node, the number that is smaller will be placed on the left child node and otherwise on the right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of trees is that they are structured so that we can conduct a **divide-and-conquer** approach to searching for information. Using a binary tree for example we can perform a **binary search** by excluding the nodes on one side of each node (starting at the root) and therefore expedite the search process. However, the trees for the same data can be constructed differently and one way to measure their difference is to count the number of edges one has to pass from the root to the leaf nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "On of the interesting issues of using a tree structure is that the same data (numbers here) can be used to construct different trees, and here are two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/trees-1.png\" width=450/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which tree is \"better\" then? To answer this question, we need to introduce a few terminologies. The **depth** of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root is 0. There is at least a leaf node on the tree that has the deepest (with the highest number of edges) from the root, and we call this depth the **height** of the tree. The ideas of depth and height can also be looked at from the perspective of each node (we just pretend the node is the root and concentrate on all the child nodes from that node). This is what we call a **subtree**, formed by a node and all its child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every node on a tree has two subtrees, left and right. This leads to the definition of a **balanced tree**: a tree where the difference in the heights of the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. A wordier way to say the same, but using the term depth, is this: a balanced tree is a tree where the difference in the depths of the deepest leaf nodes in the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. To this definition (there are different definitions too), the above two tree are not balanced, but the first tree is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of numbers, we can build a binary tree from scratch. We use the first number as the root and the next number will be the left child node of the root if it is smaller than the toot, or the right if greater. The process continues until all numbers are included in the tree. [**This video**](https://mediasite.osu.edu/Mediasite/Play/1d687e1028db46b8a91ba03907469b3d1d) explains the process.\n",

    "We write a class to store the most fundamental concept in a tree: its nodes. Each **node** has three members: data that stores whatever information we want to store for the tree, and the left and right child nodes of each node. We can store \"whatever\" information in the data member, but we have an important assumption: we must be able to conduct **comparison** between such data. Numbers are naturally in the category because we know how to compare them. For other type of data, we must override the logic operators to make sure comparison can be done (see an example of the Point class we discussed in the previous section of this class).\n",

For example, we can insert a new node to between two nodes, or we can always insert child nodes to leaf nodes. We use the latter approach here. To do so, however, we will need to be able to find the appropriate leaf node. We write a function called **search_bt** for this purpose. This is a **recursive** function since we can continuously call this function until we reach a leaf node.\n",

The latter case is useful when we try to decide where to put a new node — it must be the node that is the immediate parent node of the new node.\n",

A perfectly balanced tree with a height of $H$ will be able to hold a total of $2^0 +2^1 +2^2 +...+2^H = 2^{H+1}−1$ items. In other words, if we have $n$ items that need to be indexed using a balanced tree, the height of that tree is of the order of, again using the Big-O notation,  $O(\\log_2n)$, which is also the running time of search using that tree. This is a significantly more efficient way of search with a **logarithmic time complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we should be able to answer questions like this: what is the minimum height of a balanced binary tree to hold 100 nodes? We need to find the smallest $H$ value so that $2^{H+1}-1$ is greater than 100. This is also a question for this week's exercises and the Before you go... quiz.\n",
