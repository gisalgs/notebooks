    "# Case Study: Accessibility - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Columbus has put together a collection of points of interest for different functional categories. This data can be viewed at their interactive map https://opendata.columbus.gov/datasets/columbus::points-of-interest/explore. The description of the data can be found at https://maps2.columbus.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Schemas/PointsOfInterest/MapServer/10. The raw geojson file has been posted at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gisalgs/data/refs/heads/master/columbus_points_of_interest.geojson, which can also be downloaded from their interactive map page. We will use this geojson file in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the use of Python for spatial data analysis. More specifically, we will examine how residents in Franklin county can access some of the services represented in this data set. Of course the data is probably incomplete because it may not fully cover areas outside the city of Columbus and some points of interest may not be included in the data either. The main purpose is to demonstrate the use of data and Python coding to analyze accessibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to treat this tutorial as a working notebook (it is indeed a Jupyter Notebook). Only the code for the beginning is included. Students will need to type the code by following the video or in-class instruction. Markdown cells should also be used to explain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finishing this tutorial, students should answer the following questions (with code and results from the code):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many types of points of interest are represented in the data and how many instances are there in each type?\n",
    "2. How the POIs are distributed on a map? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are going to run every piece of code on a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab server, we get direct access to the cloud. Luckily everything we use, the data and library will all be available in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's make sure we have the geometry module used so far in this class cloned in our current working environment. After the following two lines of code, a colder called geom will be created and every file in the geom repo will be cloned to that folder. This allows us to directly use the geom modules without any additional process."
