    "The goal of a map projection is to transform points in a spherical coordinate system onto a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. In other words, points on earth surface that are measured in longitude ($\\lambda$) and latitude ($\\varphi$) pairs become points on a two dimensional plane measured as horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) coordinates. We can imagine there are functions that takes in the longitude and latitude of a point and returns the X and Y coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = f(\\lambda, \\varphi)$  \n",
    "$y = f(\\lambda, \\varphi)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward transformation from a mathematical perspective is the special case of the **equirectangular** projection that basically does not do anything other than just use the longitude as the X coordinate, and latitude as Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = \\lambda$  \n",
    "$y = \\varphi$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how any projection actually looks like, we will need the appropriate data sets to begin with. Specifically we need two kinds of data here, the world coast lines and the graticule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The world coast lines from Natural Earth, in two formats:\n",
    "    * A shapefile that is compressed as a tar.gz file at the [Github site](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.tar.gz) (need to uncompress it after downloading).\n",
    "    * A GeoJSON file at the [Github site](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson). Click on the Raw button to save the file or directly download it at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gisalgs/data/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson.\n",
    "    * Both file formats can be useful on local computers. However, the GeoJSON is also suitable for online notebooks and can be used without being downloaded to local computers as well. This is also a place to re-enforce the difference between the two formats and appreciate why GeoJSON has picked so much popularity lately. Clicking on [this link](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/ne_110m_coastline.geojson) allows us to see immediately rendering of the spatial data in the GeoJSON file, which is made possible by a lot of reasons but first reason being everything in the spatial data is encoded in ONE place/file and in plain text. This enables the file to be read and processed easily in different programming languages. [Here](https://github.com/gisalgs/data/blob/master/uscnty48area.geojson) is another example of GeoJSON using the counties data. But shapefile, unfortunately, is not designed in this way, which is understandable given how old this one is, because it has multiples file encoded in binary code that must be specially decoded.\n",
    "* The graticule is a geojson file that can be downloaded at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gisalgs/data/refs/heads/master/graticule.geojson. Wew will also discuss how this file is generated, as a way to review geojson.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Terminology:** The term graticule is commonly used in cartography, referring to the network formed by the lines of latitudes and longitudes, or parallels and meridians. Sometimes people use the term grid for this purpose, but we as geospatial professionals should know better: lines that form a grid are not necessarily parallels and meridians. We can use any lines to make up a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's decide on how we want our data to be organized. While there are many ways to do this, the bottom line for an projection is that we must be able to change the coordinates of each point from one system to another. There is not way this can be avoid. For this reason, we will literally store each point individually. Along with the point's coordinates, we also give it a unique number that indicates which line this point belongs to. For example, we make sure `[12, -83, 40]` is the point that is on a line with an ID of 12, and the coordinates of the point is -83, 40 (sounds familiar?). We will then put all the points in this way, in a list. In other words, here is how we encode each point here:\n",

The `with` statement does just that: it makes sure we can continue to hold the file for reading and writing, and it will release the resource (i.e., file) when we are done. In Python, a `with` statement uses a colon to specific the code that will handle the file.

There are patterns that an equal area projection should follow (as discussed in many cartography classes) and we can use those to make some educated conclusions. We can also use math to tell. For a project based on a sphere with a unit radius, an equal area projection will have the following property (Snyder 1987, p. 28):\n",

The idea is to put some infinitely small circles of the same size (mathematically unit size) at different places on the globe and then see how they look after they are projected. The original tool is a mathematically tool (who else would be interested in circles that are infinitely small?), but we can definitely relax it a little bit by using some circles that are more legible.
